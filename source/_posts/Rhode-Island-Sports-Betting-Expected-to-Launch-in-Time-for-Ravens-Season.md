#  Rhode Island Sports Betting Expected to Launch in Time for Ravens Season

The state of Rhode Island is expected to offer sports betting in time for the start of the NFL season.

Rhode Island legalized sports betting in June, and officials say they are on track to have the necessary systems in place by the end of September. That would allow the state to start taking bets on NFL games just in time for Week 1.

Mississippi is the only other state where sports betting will be available in time for the start of the NFL season. Eight states have already launched sports betting, but all of those states except Mississippi are offering only parlay wagers on football games.

Rhode Island is one of 10 states that has passed a law authorizing online sports betting. The first wave of legalized sports betting was mostly limited to states that already had casinos, but now that the U.S. Supreme Court has struck down the federal ban on sports betting, more states are moving to legalize it.

Rhode Island's new law allows bets to be placed both online and at land-based casinos in the state. It also allows bets on professional and college sports, as well as other events such as golf and NASCAR races.

State officials say they expect to generate about $23 million in annual revenue from sports betting, which will be used to help fund education and tourism initiatives.

#  Rhode Island Poised to Lead the Way in NFL Sports Betting

Rhode Island is on the verge of becoming a leading force in NFL sports betting, as lawmakers are pushing for a bill that would legalize and regulate the industry. The state has long been a gambling stronghold, with casinos dotting the landscape, so it’s no surprise that officials are looking to capitalize on the growing popularity of sports betting.

If the bill is approved, Rhode Island would join a handful of states that have legalized sports betting in recent years. The move comes as the NFL faces increasing scrutiny over its handling of player safety and concussion prevention. As more states legalize sports betting, the NFL may be forced to change its stance on the issue.

So far, only a few states have taken advantage of the Supreme Court’s decision last year to overturn a federal ban on sports betting. New Jersey was among the first to enact legislation, and Delaware and West Virginia have also opened up their borders to sports betting. In all, there are now nine states where you can place a legal bet on NFL games.

Rhode Island lawmakers believe that their state can be a leader in this burgeoning industry. “This is an opportunity for Rhode Island to lead the way in terms of creating an industry that’s going to be very beneficial to our state in terms of economic development and creating jobs,” said State Representative Anastasia Williams.

The proposed bill would establish regulations for both brick-and-mortar and online sportsbooks. It would also allow for wagering on college games, although bets on professional games would take precedence. Officials believe that legalizing sports betting could generate as much as $23 million in annual revenue for the state.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to increased addiction and social ills, but supporters contend that such problems already exist with casino gambling. They believe that regulating sports betting will help ensure that players are protected and that proceeds are taxed appropriately.

It remains to be seen whether Rhode Island will be successful in legalizing sports betting, but there is no doubt that the industry is growing rapidly. With more states jumping on board, it may only be a matter of time before the NFL has no choice but to adapt its stance on the issue.

#  Legal Sports Gambling Coming to Rhode Island Just in Time for Ravens Games

In a stunning turn of events, Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo has announced that legal sports gambling will commence in the state starting September 1st, just in time for the first NFL games of the season. This comes as a big surprise to many, as Rhode Island was not thought to be one of the more likely states to legalize sports betting.

The news is sure to please Ravens fans in the state, who will now be able to place bets on their favorite team’s games. The legalization of sports gambling is also expected to generate a great deal of revenue for Rhode Island, with some estimating that it could bring in as much as $23 million per year.

It’s not yet clear exactly how the sports gambling industry will work in Rhode Island, but Governor Raimondo has promised that there will be “robust consumer protections” in place. This means that gamblers will have to be at least 21 years old and will have to abide by betting limits. In addition, all casinos and racetracks in the state will offer sports betting services.

Governor Raimondo is obviously thrilled about the news. “This is great news for Rhode Island,” she said at a press conference on Wednesday. “Legalized sports betting will bring jobs and tourism to our state, and it will help us raise much-needed revenue for vital public services like education and infrastructure. I encourage all residents who are interested in placing bets on NFL games to visit one of our casinos or racetracks starting September 1st.”

Not everyone is happy about the news, however. The major professional sports leagues – including the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL – have long been opposed to legalized sports gambling, arguing that it could lead to game-fixing and other forms of cheating. It remains to be seen whether they will challenge Rhode Island’s new law in court.

#  Rhode Island Set to Get Into the Sports Betting Game with Baltimore Ravens Futures

The Rhode Island legislature has passed a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state, starting with bets on the future of the Baltimore Ravens.

Supporters of the bill say that it would bring in much-needed revenue to the state, which is facing a budget shortfall. The Rhode Island Department of Revenue estimates that sports betting could generate as much as $23 million in annual revenue.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to increased problems with gambling addiction and crime. They also note that neighboring states such as Massachusetts and Connecticut have already legalized sports betting and that Rhode Island would be at a disadvantage if it does not do so as well.

Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo has not yet said whether she will sign or veto the bill.
