#  Arsenal FC to Play in Texas

Arsenal FC has announced that it will play in the Texan city of Dallas in a preseason game on July 17th. The game, to be played at the home of MLS side FC Dallas, will see the Gunners take on Mexican club Chivas Guadalajara.

This will not be the first time Arsenal have played in Texas - they faced off against the now-defunct Houston Dynamo in 2006. That game was won by Arsenal 3-0, with goals from Sol Campbell, Robin van Persie, and José Antonio Reyes.

For Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger, the game against Chivas Guadalajara presents an opportunity to test his team against a strong Mexican opponent. "It will be a good preparation game for us because Mexico is a good team," he said. "They have players who play in Europe so we will see how well we can do against them."

The match in Dallas is part of Arsenal's preparations for the 2016/17 season, which kicks off with an away fixture against Liverpool on August 14th.

#  Arsenal FC Set for Friendly Match in Texas

Arsenal FC is set to play a friendly match in Arlington, Texas against the MLS team FC Dallas on July 31. The match will take place at the home of the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys, AT&T Stadium. This will be Arsenal’s second visit to the United States this summer, after playing a match against Chelsea in Washington D.C.

FC Dallas is one of the most successful teams in MLS, having won the league championship in 2018. This will be a good test for Arsenal as they prepare for their new Premier League season, which starts on August 11.

The match in Arlington will also be a homecoming for Gunners defender Sead Kolasinac, who spent part of his childhood in nearby Fort Worth. Kolasinac is looking forward to playing in front of his friends and family:

"It will be great to play in my hometown," said Kolasinac. "I have a lot of friends and family coming to watch me so it will be a special day."

Tickets for the match go on sale on Friday, June 14 at 10 a.m. Central Time.

#  Texas Welcomes Arsenal FC for Friendly Match

The Texas soccer community will get a chance to see one of Europe’s top soccer clubs when Arsenal FC visits BBVA Compass Stadium on Thursday, July 19.

Arsenal is an English Premier League club that has won 13 league titles and 10 FA Cups. BBVA Compass Stadium is the home of the Houston Dynamo of MLS, which also won two MLS Cup titles in its first decade in existence.

Houston Dynamo President Chris Canetti said, “This is a marquee event for our club and our fans. We are excited about the opportunity to host one of the most successful clubs in world soccer. Arsenal is a huge brand with a massive following and we know that their visit will be special for all involved.”

Tickets for the match go on sale to the general public on Friday, May 4 at 10:00 a.m. CT through www.houstondynamo.com/tickets or by calling (713) 276-GOAL. 

Arsenal last played in North America in 2016 as part of its preseason preparations for the upcoming EPL season. The Gunners faced Mexican side Chivas de Guadalajara at StubHub Center in Carson, California, losing 3-1.

#  Arsenal FC Finds New Home in Texas

The Premier League team Arsenal FC has announced that it is moving its operations to Texas. The team will be relocating its training center and headquarters to a new facility in Dallas.

Arsenal FC's Chief Commercial Officer, Vinai Venkatesham, made the announcement on behalf of the team. He said that the new facility in Dallas would house all of the team's operations, including its training center and corporate offices. He also noted that the club was excited about its new partnership with Texas oil billionaires Tom and Gayle Hunt.

The Hunts are the primary owners of the Dallas Cowboys NFL franchise. They are also involved in other business ventures, including real estate and energy production. Venkatesham said that the Hunts were committed to helping Arsenal FC build a successful future in Texas.

The move to Texas comes at a time of transition for Arsenal FC. The team has been without a permanent manager since Arsene Wenger stepped down at the end of last season. Wenger had been with the club for 22 years, making him one of the longest-serving managers in Premier League history.

Arsenal FC is also in the process of renovating its historic stadium, Emirates Stadium. The renovations are expected to cost over $600 million and will be completed by 2021. The new stadium will have a capacity of 60,000 seats and will be one of the most modern stadiums in Europe.

With these changes taking place, it makes sense for Arsenal FC to establish a presence in Texas. The state is home to over 26 million people and has a thriving economy. It is also home to several other major sports teams, including the Cowboys, Houston Texans NFL franchise, Dallas Mavericks NBA team, and Houston Astros MLB team.

Arsenal FC's move to Dallas should help them increase their fan base in Texas. It should also help them build stronger partnerships with local businesses and promote tourism in Dallas.

#  Arsenal FC to Play in San Antonio, TX

Arsenal FC, one of the most popular soccer clubs in the world, announced on Wednesday that it will play an exhibition match against Mexican side C.D. Guadalajara at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas on Thursday, May 17th.

The match is part of Arsenal’s preseason tour of the United States and Canada and will give fans in San Antonio a chance to see two of the best clubs in North America battle it out.

“We are delighted to be coming to San Antonio and playing at the Alamodome,” said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. “It is always great to play in front of new fans and we are looking forward to putting on a good show for them.”

This is not the first time that Arsenal has played in Texas – they also played an exhibition match against Liga MX side Club America at Houston’s BBVA Compass Stadium last year. The Gunners won that match by a score of 2-1.

Tickets for the match against Guadalajara go on sale this Friday, March 9th and can be purchased through Ticketmaster.
