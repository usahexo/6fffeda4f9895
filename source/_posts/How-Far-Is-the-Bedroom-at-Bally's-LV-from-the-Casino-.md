#  How Far Is the Bedroom at Bally's LV from the Casino? 

The Bally's Las Vegas hotel and casino is a large resort located on the Las Vegas Strip. It has over 2,800 rooms and almost 100,000 square feet of casino space. If you're looking to gamble, the Bally's casino has everything from slot machines and table games to a race and sports book. 

While the Bally's casino is certainly a great place to spend some time, many visitors also want to know how far their bedroom is from the action. Unfortunately, there's no easy answer to that question. The distance between the casino and different areas of the hotel can vary significantly, depending on which wing you're in. 

That being said, if you're looking for a ballpark estimate, we'd say that the casino is about half a mile from the furthest room in the hotel. So if you're looking to be close to all the action, we'd recommend booking a room in one of the lower wings of the property.
