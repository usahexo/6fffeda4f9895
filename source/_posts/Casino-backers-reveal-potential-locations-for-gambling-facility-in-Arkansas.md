#  Casino backers reveal potential locations for gambling facility in Arkansas

Arkansas election officials say casino backers have turned in petitions to place a proposal to allow a gambling facility on the ballot.

The petitions were submitted Tuesday, and they need signatures from 84,859 registered voters to make the ballot. The proposed constitutional amendment would allow up to three casinos in Arkansas.

Supporters hope to see the amendment approved so a gambling facility could be built in central Arkansas. Casino backers recently released potential locations for the facility, but they have not revealed who is backing the proposal.

Meanwhile, lawmakers are considering a measure that would allow for a separate casino proposal in Pope County. That measure would also put the decision before voters.

#  Arkansas lawmakers react to casino proposal, location still undecided

The possibility of a casino being located in Arkansas has sparked mixed reactions from lawmakers. Governor Asa Hutchinson has voiced his support for the measure, while some legislators are still undecided on the issue.

Under the proposed legislation, a casino could be built in either Boone or Miller counties. Lawmakers representing those areas are still considering the proposal, and no decision has been made yet.

Governor Asa Hutchinson issued a statement in support of the measure, saying that it would create jobs and boost the economy. He also said that the location of the casino would be decided by a vote of the people in Boone or Miller counties.

Some lawmakers are still undecided on the issue, including State Representative Warwick Sabin. He said that he is still researching the proposal and hasn't made a final decision yet.

State Senator Uvalde Lindsey said that he opposes the measure, citing concerns about gambling addiction. He also said that he is worried about how a casino would affect local businesses.

#  Proposed casino to be located in Fort Smith or West Memphis?

Arkansas is looking to expand its gambling options, and a new casino has been proposed for the border of Fort Smith and West Memphis. The proposed casino would be owned and operated by the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, who run casinos in Alabama and Florida.

The tribe is proposing to build a $250 million casino resort that would include a hotel, restaurants, and a gaming floor. If approved, the casino would create 1,000 jobs.

 supporters of the casino say that it would be a major boon for the local economy, while opponents worry about the potential for gambling addiction and crime.

A decision on the proposal is expected in early 2019.

#  Casino backers say they have the votes to pass legislation for gambling facility in Arkansas

# Pro-casino lawmakers say they have the votes to legalize a gambling facility in Arkansas, even as opponents protest that the move will hurt the state’s economy.

# The Senate voted Tuesday to allow a statewide vote on whether to approve a casino. The proposal now goes to the House.

# *Gambling is an issue that cuts across social and economic lines. Some people see it as a sin, while others see it as a way to make money.*

# *Arkansas is one of six states without legalized gambling, and some lawmakers say it’s time for the state to catch up with its neighbors.*

# *Opponents of legalizing casinos say they are worried about the social ills that can accompany gambling: problem gambling, crime and corruption.*

# *They also argue that casinos will cannibalize business at existing racetracks and riverboat casinos in the state, costing jobs and tax revenue.*

# *Proponents of casinos argue that the venues will create jobs and generate much-needed revenue for the state.*

#  Arkansas casino proposal faces opposition from religious groups

Arkansas’s proposed casino has faced opposition from religious groups, who argue that the gambling facility would be harmful to the state’s citizens. The proposal, which is backed by a group of investors, would see a casino built in Pine Bluff, an area that is currently lacking in entertainment options.

Opponents of the proposal have voiced concern over the potential for gambling addiction and other negative consequences associated with casinos. They also argue that the casino would harm local businesses and that the revenues it generates would not be enough to offset these negative effects.

Casino backers have responded to these criticisms, arguing that the casino would create jobs and bring much-needed tourism dollars to Pine Bluff. They also maintain that gambling addiction is a personal responsibility issue, not one that should be blamed on the casino itself.

The fate of Arkansas’s proposed casino remains to be seen, but it looks likely to face strong opposition from religious groups in the coming months.
