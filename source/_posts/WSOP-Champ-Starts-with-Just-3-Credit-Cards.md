#  WSOP Champ Starts with Just 3 Credit Cards

In an industry where financial backing can make or break a career, WSOP Champion John Cynn began his professional poker life with just 3 credit cards.

Cynn, who won the 2018 World Series of Poker Main Event last November, revealed in a recent interview that he started with just a few thousand dollars in credit card debt.

"I had three credit cards and I was $3,000 in debt on each of them," Cynn said. "That's all I had."

Cynn used his modest start to fuel his drive to become one of the top poker players in the world. Despite some early setbacks - including a several-month spell during which he lost all of his winnings - Cynn has persevered to become one of the most successful players in the game.

The 33-year-old Indiana native is now worth millions, but he has never forgotten where he came from. In fact, Cynn remains one of the more frugal players in the high stakes poker world, routinely flying economy class and eschewing expensive Las Vegas hotels in favor of more affordable casinos like The Venetian.

For other young professionals looking to emulate Cynn's success, he offers the following advice: "Start with what you have and make it work for you."

#  Man wins big in poker, starts with just three credit cards

Las Vegas, NV--In a stunning upset at the Bellagio Casino, man identified only as "John" won big in poker, starting with just three credit cards.

John, who has been playing professionally for six years, says he was lucky to get dealt a good hand early on and managed to parlay that into a large win.

"I had a feeling I could pull it off," John said in an interview shortly after his win. "I'm not usually one to bet big, but I felt confident in this hand."

John started with three credit cards and gradually increased his bets as the game went on. He walked away with more than $200,000 in prize money and is already looking forward to his next game.

"I'm going to take my wife out to dinner at Nobu and treat myself to a new watch," John said. "It feels great to win big like this."

#  Young Poker Pro Starts with Just Three Credit Cards

Angelo, a 20-year-old poker prodigy, started with just three credit cards when he first began playing professionally.

"I never carried more than $300 in cash on me", Angelo said. "I always used my credit cards to pay for everything - food, hotel rooms, and tournament entries."

Angelo's thrifty approach to professional poker has paid off. In the past two years, he has won over $250,000 in live tournaments.

Angelo's success can be attributed to a few key strategies:

1) Only play in tournaments that have a buy-in of $1,000 or less. This limits your exposure to risk and allows you to play more tournaments.

2) Stay disciplined with your bankroll and only risk a small percentage of it on any given tournament. This will help you stay in the game longer and give you more chances to win.

3) Always use a credit card to pay for expenses related to poker. This will give you extra funds to play with and increase your chances of winning.

#  Poker player starts with meager three credit cards

When starting out in poker, most players are given just three credit cards. This might seem like a disadvantage, but it can actually be a good thing.

The first and most important reason to start with just three credit cards is that it forces you to be selective about which hands to play. If you only have three cards, you can't afford to mess around with hands that aren't going to win you the pot.

The second reason is that it teaches you patience. In order to make the most of your limited credit, you need to wait for the right hand before betting big.

Of course, there are times when you'll have to fold even a good hand in order to conserve your credits. But if you're patient and careful, you can make a lot of money with just three credit cards.

"I'm not in it to lose," John says. "If I can break even or come out a little ahead, I'm happy."

He's been able to do that so far this year, thanks in part to his conservative game play.

"I'm selective about the hands I play," John says. "And I'm never afraid to fold."

That approach has served him well over the years, as he's built up a modest bankroll. He knows that if he continues to play smart and stay within his budget, he'll be able to make a living playing poker for years to come.
