#  Diamondbacks Secure Second Place in NL West with Check-In Win Over Rockies

The Arizona Diamondbacks had little trouble with the Colorado Rockies in their latest matchup, cruising to an easy 8-1 victory. With the Dodgers' loss to the Padres later in the day, the D-backs are now officially second in the NL West.

The game was close until the fourth inning, when Arizona erupted for six runs. A key two-run homer by Ketel Marte got things started, and David Peralta followed with a solo shot of his own. Paul Goldschmidt also drove in a run with a bases-loaded double.

Patrick Corbin got the start for Arizona and turned in another strong performance. He allowed just one run on four hits over six innings, striking out six batters along the way. Jake Barrett and Fernando Rodney closed things out without incident.

With this win, Arizona improved to 71-68 on the season and pulled to within 2 1/2 games of first place LA. They'll look to inch closer to the top spot when they take on the Rockies again on Wednesday night.

#  Arizona Pushes Forward With Check-In Strategy, Beats Giants 5-4

The Arizona Diamondbacks are on a roll, with their latest victory coming against the San Francisco Giants. The D-backs got off to an early lead and never looked back, winning by a score of 5-4.

This was a crucial game for Arizona, as they continue to battle for a playoff spot. They now have a record of 78-64, which puts them in 3rd place in the NL West.

The Giants (71-70) are in 4th place, and are in danger of being eliminated from playoff contention.

One of the key players for Arizona was catcher Alex Avila. He went 2-for-3 with 2 RBIs, including the game-winning hit in the 8th inning.

"Alex had some big hits for us today," said manager Torey Lovullo. "He's been swinging the bat really well recently."

Avila has been one of Arizona's most consistent hitters this season. He is now batting .269 with 16 homers and 50 RBIs.

Meanwhile, the Giants continue to struggle at the plate. They were held to just 4 hits against the Diamondbacks' pitching staff. Buster Posey had 2 of those hits, including a solo homer in the 9th inning.

Posey is currently batting .285 with 17 homers and 66 RBIs this season. However, other members of San Francisco's lineup have not been as productive.

This was just their 3rd loss in their last 10 games overall. But they will need to improve offensively if they hope to make a late push for the playoffs.

#  Check-In Dodgers Fall to Diamondbacks 8-1

The Dodgers headed into their matchup against the Diamondbacks looking to clinch the NL West division. However, they would suffer an 8-1 loss and fall 2.5 games behind the Colorado Rockies in the process.

Corey Seager got the scoring started with a leadoff homer in the first inning, but that was all the Dodgers could muster against Zack Greinke and co. The Diamondbacks bullpen was also impressive, holding down the fort after Greinke was pulled in the sixth inning.

Meanwhile, Arizona's offense did plenty of damage against Alex Wood and company. Ketel Marte led off the game with a triple and A.J. Pollock added an RBI double later in the contest. Paul Goldschmidt also hit his 31st homer of the season in the win.

With their second consecutive loss, LA's magic number to clinch the division remains at three games. They'll look to get back on track when they take on San Francisco on Tuesday night.

#  Rockies Nearly Sweep Arizona But D'Backs Win In Check-In Contest

The Arizona Diamondbacks squeaked by the Colorado Rockies in a contest that determined which team would check in first at their hotel for their upcoming three-game series. The Rockies had taken the first two games of the series handily, but narrowly lost out on a chance to sweep when the Diamondbacks managed to get to the front desk before them.

"We were pretty confident going into it," said Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado. "But they just happened to get there a little bit earlier."

Both teams were clearly exhausted after playing nine innings of baseball; the Diamondbacks looked particularly drained after losing the previous two games. "We're just happy to get this one and move on," said Arizona shortstop Nick Ahmed.

The Diamondbacks will now look to salvage the series with Colorado with two games at home. They open up a four-game series against the San Francisco Giants on Monday.

#  A Swing and a Check-In: Giants Outlast the Diamondbacks in 10 Innings

SAN FRANCISCO - In the top of the 10th inning, with the bases loaded and the Giants trailing by one run, Brandon Crawford came to the plate. He had already hit a double in the game, and he was looking to do something big.

Crawford hit a hard ground ball right at Diamondbacks first baseman Paul Goldschmidt. Goldschmidt made the play and looked like he might be able to get a double play. But Crawford beat the throw to first, and the Giants had life.

One out later, with Buster Posey up, Diamondbacks pitcher Andrew Chafin threw a wild pitch, allowing Crawford to score the tying run.

Posey then hit a sacrifice fly to center fielder A.J. Pollock, scoring Hunter Pence from third base and giving the Giants a 5-4 lead.

 Sergio Romo came in to close out the game for the Giants, and he did just that. The Giants won 5-4 and improved their record to 37-33 on the season.

"It was a great win," said Giants manager Bruce Bochy after the game. "We battled back and our bullpen did a great job."

The Giants bullpen was indeed impressive on Monday night. Rookie Ray Black got his first career victory after pitching two innings of scoreless relief, while Tony Watson pitched a perfect ninth inning for his 12th save of the season.

The Diamondbacks (39-32) also had an impressive outing from their bullpen. Chafin (1-2) got the win after pitching two innings of shutout relief, while Brad Boxberger picked up his 14th save of the season by pitching a perfect 10th inning.

"That was an amazing game," said Goldschmidt after the game. "Both teams played really hard."
