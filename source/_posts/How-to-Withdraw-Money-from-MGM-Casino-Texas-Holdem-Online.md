There are a few ways to take money out of the MGM Casino. You can either use the ATMs on the casino floor, or you can go to the cage and ask for a payout.

When you use an ATM, you will be charged a fee by the casino, as well as by your bank. The amount of the fee varies, but it is typically around $4 per transaction. If you want to avoid this fee, you can go to the cage and ask for a payout.
