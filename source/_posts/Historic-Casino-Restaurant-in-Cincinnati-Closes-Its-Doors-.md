#  Historic Casino Restaurant in Cincinnati Closes Its Doors 

The historic casino restaurant in Cincinnati has closed its doors after more than six decades of operation. The restaurant was a popular destination for locals and tourists alike, serving up a variety of Italian-American cuisine.

Owners announced the closure in a Facebook post, writing "It is with great sadness that we must announce the closing of Casino Restaurant." They thanked customers for their support over the years and said they would "cherish the memories made at this establishment."

The casino restaurant first opened in 1956, and was well known for its expansive menu, including dishes such as lasagna, chicken parmesan, and spaghetti and meatballs. It was also known for its impressive wine list, featuring selections from around the world.

The casino restaurant was located in the heart of Cincinnati's downtown district, making it a popular spot for business meetings and special occasions. In recent years, however, it had seen a decline in patronage as newer restaurants sprung up in the area.

Owner Dominic Fanelli cited financial difficulties as the reason for the closure. He said he was "incredibly grateful" to the staff who have worked at the casino restaurant over the years.
