#  How to make the gambling bot in discord – The easy way!

Creating a gambling bot for Discord can be a fun and easy project, especially if you use a pre-made library. In this article, we will show you how to make a gambling bot in Discord using the Discord.js library.

First, you will need to create a new Discord server and invite your friends to join. Once you have done that, head over to https://discord.js.org/ and select the “Clone or Download” button. Then, select “Download ZIP”.

Once the zip file has been downloaded, extract it to a new folder on your computer. Open up the folder and locate the file called “index.html”. Double-click on it to open it in your web browser.

You should see a web page that looks something like this:


Now, click on the “Create an App” button at the top of the page. In the “Name” field, enter a name for your app (e.g GamblingBot). Click on the “Create App” button.

You should now see a page that looks like this:


Click on the “Create Bot User” button and enter a name for your bot user (e.g GamblingBot). Then, click on the “Create Bot User” button. You will now see some information about your bot user, including its ID number (e.g 526860923529464384). Copy this number down as you will need it later.

Next, head back over to the Discord server that you created earlier and click on the gear icon at the bottom left hand corner of the screen. Select “Copy Webhook URL” from the menu that appears:


Paste this URL into a text editor (e.g Notepad) and save it somewhere safe – you will need it later.

Next, download and install NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/. Once NodeJS has been installed, open up a command prompt window and navigate to the folder where you extracted discord.js earlier. Type in the following command:
npm install discord-bot -g


This will install discord-bot globally on your system so that you can run it from any directory. Next, type in the following command to start your bot:discord-bot --token=526860923529464384


Replace 526860923529464384 with the Bot User ID number that you copied down earlier. Your bot should now start up and begin listening for messages!

#  How to make the gambling bot in discord – The hard way!

In this article, we are going to talk about how to make a gambling bot for discord – the hard way. By “hard way”, we mean that we are not going to use any premade tools or libraries. Instead, we will be writing all of the code from scratch! This may seem like a lot of work, but it is actually a great way to learn how bots work.

We are going to start by creating a basic discord bot. This bot will only have one command: /gambling . When someone types this command, the bot will will give them one random number between 1 and 100. We will then write some code that will allow the user to gamble this number.

To start, we need to create a new discord app and add our bot user to it. We can do this by following these steps:

1. Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me and click “Create an App”.

2. Enter a name for your app and click “Create”.

3. On the next screen, click “Add Bot User”.

4. Click “Yes, Do It!” on the next dialog box.







 








It should now look like this:







  Now that our app has been created, we need to add some permissions so that our bot can interact with discord servers. To do this, click on the button that says “Settings > Permissions > What type of permission do you need?” and select “Manage Messages” and “Send Messages”:It should now look like this:Now that our app has been created, we need to add some permissions so that our bot can interact with discord servers. To do this, click on the button that says “Settings > Permissions > What type of permission do you need?” and select “Manage Messages” and “Send Messages”: It should now look like this: 

  5. Click on the button that says “Update Settings” at the bottom of the page. Next, we need to create our gambling code. We are going to do this in two parts: first, we will create a function that will generate a random number between 1 and 100; second, we will write code that will allow users to gamble this number. Let's start with the random number generator function: def generate_random_number(min_num=1, max_num=100): num = random.randint(min_num, max_num) return num  Now let's write our gambling code: def gamble(amount): if amount <= 0 or amount >= 100: print("You cannot gamble " + str(amount) + "." ) elif amount <= 25: print("You have just won " + str(amount) + " coins!") elif amount >= 26 and amount <= 50: print("You have just lost " + str(amount) - 26) + " coins." ) elif amount >= 51 and amount <= 75: print("You have just won " + str(amount) - 51) + " coins." ) else : print("You have just lost " + str(amount) - 75) + " coins." ) main() The complete code for our gambling bot can be found below: import discord from random import randint ​def generate_random_number(min_num=1, max_num=100): num = random . randint ( min_num , max_num ) return num ​def gamble ( amount ): if amount <= 0 or amount >= 100 : print ( "You cannot gamble " + str ( amount ) + "." ) elif amount <= 25 : print ( "You have just won " + str ( amount ) + " coins!" ) elif amount >= 26 and amount <= 50 : print ( "You have just lost " + str ( amount ) - 26 ) + " coins." ) elif amount >= 51 and amount <= 75 : print ( "You have just won " + str ( amount ) - 51 ) + " coins." ) else : print ( "You have just lost " + str ( amount ) - 75 ))

#  How to make the gambling bot in discord – The only way!

Making a gambling bot for discord can be a little complicated, but with the right steps it can be done. In this article we will outline the process of creating your own gambling bot and give you the tools you need to make it happen.

First we need to create a new discord server, this will be our bot’s home and it is where all the commands will be run from. Once the server is created we invite our friends, or anyone else who might want to use the bot, to join us.

Now that we have our server set-up we need to create a role for our bot. This role will give our bot permissions to do certain things in the server, like send messages and add users to roles. To create a role go to Server Settings -> Permissions -> Roles and click on “Create New Role”. Here we will name our role “Gambling Bot” and give it the following permissions: Send Messages, Manage Roles, and Add Users to Roles. Click on “Create Role” and our new role will be created.

Next we need to create a new Discord Bot. To do this go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me and click on “Create A New Application”. Here we will name our Bot “GamblingBot” and for the description put something like “This is a Gambling Bot for the Discord Server Name ServerName#0000”. Click on “Create App” and our new Bot will be created. On this page you will also be given an Access Token which we will need later, so keep this page open as we will need it later.

Now that we have created our Bot we need to add it to our Discord Server. To do this open up Discord and go to Server Settings -> Bots -> Add Bot. Here we will enter the name of our Bot (GamblingBot) and paste in the Access Token from the application created earlier. Click on “Add Bot” and our Bot will be added to our Discord Server.

The final step is setting up the actual Gambling Script for our bot. This script can be found online or written yourself, but for this article we will use a pre-made script that can be found at https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anonymous/bfb9b7cdcceabd1cda226be8bd549a64/raw/. This script is written in Python 3 so make sure you have Python 3 installed before trying to run it (you can find instructions on how to install Python 3 at https://python3portingguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/) . Once Python 3 is installed open up your terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and change directories ( cd ) into the folder where you saved the Gambling Script file (in this example it would be cd Desktop\GamblingScript). Now type in python GamblingBot .py , hit enter, and if all goes well your bot should start up!

Now that everything is set-up your bot should start automatically every time your computer starts up (unless you have disabled it). To start your bot manually just open up Discord and type in !start into any chat box. To stop your bot just type in !stop into any chat box or press Ctrl+C in your terminal window running your bot script file..

#  How to make the gambling bot in discord – Tips and tricks!

Creating a discord gambling bot is pretty easy. In this article, we will show you how to make a bot and give you some tips and tricks.

First, you need to create a new discord server. This will be the home of your bot. Then, you need to invite the bot to this server. You can find the invite link on the “bot” tab of your discord server settings.

Once you have invited the bot, you need to create a new role for it. This will be the role that the bot uses to join games. To do this, go to the “roles” tab of your discord server settings and create a new role. Give this role the name “bot”.

Next, you need to create a new discord application. To do this, go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/. Click on “New Application” and enter the following information:

Name: Bot

Description: Gambling Bot for Discord Server

Bot User: Enter the name of your discord server here (e.g. https://discord.gg/Hck8bN6)

Unified ID: Leave blank

Callback URL: Leave blank







	 	 Click on “Create Application” and take note of your application ID and token. You will need these later on.

Now, you need to add some permissions to your application. To do this, click on “Permissions” in the sidebar and then click on “add permission”. Add the following permissions:

 read messages from all channels that I am a part of (required)



	 	 send messages as Bot (required)



	 	 manage roles (required)



	 	 add users to groups (optional)



	 	 manage messages (optional)

#  How to make the gambling bot in discord – Beware of scams!

Are you looking to make a gambling bot in Discord? If so, congratulations – you’ve come to the right place! This article will teach you how to make your very own gambling bot in Discord. Just beware of scams – there are a lot of them out there!

First, you’ll need to create a new Discord server. To do this, open Discord and click the + button in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen. Then, select “Create a Server”. Give your server a name and then click “Create”.

Next, you’ll need to invite some people to your server. To do this, click the gear icon in the top-right corner of the server window, and then select “invite people”. Enter the names of the people you want to invite, separating each name with a comma. Then, click “invite”.

The final step is to add bots to your server. To do this, open the Bot Store by clicking the logo in the top left-hand corner of Discord (it looks like a robot named “Discoid”). Then, type “gambling bot” into the search bar and click on the resulting result. Finally, click on the “add to server” button and then confirm by clicking on “add bot”.

Now that you have added bots to your server, it’s time to start making your own gambling bot! First, you’ll need to head over to https://discordapp.com/developers/apps and create a new application. Give your application a name and then select Python as the programming language. For now, leave everything else blank and click on “Create App”.

Discord will now generate some new keys for your application. Copy these keys and then head back over to https://discordapp.com/developers/bots/. Click on the green “create a bot” button and paste your keys into the appropriate fields. Then, click on “create bot User”.

Your new bot is now created! But before we can start coding it, we first need to install some dependencies. Open up a terminal (or command prompt if you are using Windows) and type in the following command:

pip install discord[bot]==1.*

This will install all of the necessary dependencies for our gambling bot. Now let's get coding!


Open up your favorite editor (I personally prefer VS Code) and create a new file called "gambling_bot.py". In this file, we will write all of our code for our gambling bot. Let's start by importing all of the necessary modules:

 import discord import time import random ​

Next, we will create our main() function:

 def main(): ​    print("Gambling Bot") ​    Bot = discord .Bot(token = 'xxxxxx') ​    @Bot .event async def on_message(message): print("Received message %s" % message) if "bet" in message: amount = int(message .split(" ")[1]) guessed = int(message .split(" ")[2]) playerOne = str(guessed) playerTwo = str(amount) message = "Player One guessed %s gave %d cash" % (playerOne , playerTwo ) await send_message(Bot , message) elif "roll" in message: sides = int(message .split(" ")[0]) dicetower = random .choice([ 'dice' , 'coin' ]) outcome = dicetower ( sides ) message = "{} won {} from {} using {}!" .format(dicetower , outcome , playerOne , playerTwo ) await send_message(Bot , message) else : print ("Invalid input") ​ main()
