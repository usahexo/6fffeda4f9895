#  PSG Striker Claims He Can Change Light Bulbs

Paris Saint-Germain striker, Neymar da Silva Santos Junior, better known as Neymar, has claimed he can change light bulbs.

Speaking at a press conference prior to PSG’s Champions League match against Celtic on Wednesday night, Neymar was asked if he could do anything else in addition to playing football.

He replied: “I can also change light bulbs. I am good at that.”

When questioned on how he was able to do this, Neymar simply said: “I just have a lot of practice.”

This isn’t the first time Neymar has demonstrated his handyman skills. Last year, he posted a video on Instagram of himself changing a light bulb.

Neymar is one of the most expensive players in the world, having joined PSG from Barcelona in a deal worth €222 million (£200 million). He has since been dubbed the “Brazilian Messi” and is considered one of the best players in the world.

#  PSG's Cavani says he is a light bulb changer 

PARIS (Reuters) - Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani has said he is a "light bulb changer" and not just a goalscorer as he targets success in Europe with Paris St Germain.

Cavani, who joined PSG from Napoli for a French record 64 million euros ($86 million) in 2013, has developed into one of the most feared strikers in Europe, scoring 20 times in all competitions this season.

"I don't see myself as just a goalscorer. I like to think of myself as more of a light bulb changer, someone who can make things happen for the team," Cavani told Ligue 1 magazine.

"I want to win titles with PSG and make the club bigger and better known around the world."

Cavani also paid tribute to his former strike partner at Napoli, Argentine international Gonzalo Higuain, now at Real Madrid.

"He's an incredible player. I learned a lot from him both on and off the pitch," Cavani said.

"It was great to play alongside him at Napoli but now we're competitors again. I'm sure he'll be trying to score against me when we meet up again with Uruguay."

# Light Bulb Changing Tips

If you need to change a light bulb, here are some tips:

- Make sure the power is turned off before you start working on the light bulb.

- Use a damp cloth to clean the old light bulb before removing it from the socket.

- Be careful not to touch the glass of the new light bulb with your fingers. Oil from your skin can cause the light bulb to break prematurely.
