#  Neymar Jr. Leads Brazil to Victory with a Green Hat Trick

In the seventy-sixth minute of the match, Neymar Jr. made an incredible pass to Philippe Coutinho who then scored Brazil’s fourth goal. The win secured Brazil’s passage to the quarterfinals of the 2018 World Cup.

Neymar Jr. started the scoring in the eleventh minute when he converted a penalty kick. He then added two more goals before halftime, making him the first Brazilian player to score a hat trick in a World Cup match since Ronaldo in 2006.

This victory gives Brazil some much-needed momentum after a difficult start to the tournament that saw them suffer a 1-2 loss to Switzerland in their opening game. Neymar Jr., who was criticized for his play in that match, showed that he is still one of the best players on the planet, scoring one goal and assisting on two others.

With this hat trick, Neymar has now tied Pelé’s Brazilian national team record of fifty-seven goals. He is also now the all-time leading scorer for Brazil in World Cup matches with twelve goals, surpassing Ronaldo’s eleven goals.

After this victory, Neymar will undoubtedly be even more motivated to lead Brazil all the way to victory in this year’s World Cup.

#  Coutinho and Firmino Strike Again as Liverpool dominate the Green Roulette Tables

Liverpool proved their dominance over other clubs in the Premier League yet again with a 3-0 win over Huddersfield Town at Anfield. Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino were the stars of the show, finding the back of the net twice each and leading Liverpool to an easy victory.

The first goal of the match came in the eighth minute, when Coutinho played a magnificent ball through to Firmino who finished clinically. The Brazilian duo linked up again just before halftime, with Coutinho this time providing the assist as Firmino doubled Liverpool’s lead.

Huddersfield Town offered very little in attack and Liverpool looked comfortable for the most part. The third goal finally arrived in injury time, as Coutinho completed his brace by firing home from close range. It was a deserved win for Liverpool, who now sit four points clear at the top of the Premier League table.

Coutinho and Firmino have now scored six goals between them this season and look unstoppable. If they can continue this form then Liverpool will be in a very strong position to challenge for the Premier League title.

#  Manchester City’s Brazilian Star Gabriel Jesus Shows his Skills on Green Roulette

Manchester City’s Brazilian Star Gabriel Jesus displayed his skills on green roulette as he marked his return to action with a goal and an assist in the 3-1 win over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.

The 20-year-old, who had been out of action since late February with a knee ligament injury, set up the opening goal for Sergio Aguero in the first half before doubling Manchester City’s lead after the break.

Arsenal pulled one back through Alexandre Lacazette but it was not enough to prevent Pep Guardiola’s side from taking all three points and keeping their Premier League title challenge on track.

Speaking after the game, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said: “Gabriel Jesus is so special. He makes something happen. It was great for him to be back on the pitch and score.”

Jesus himself was delighted to be back in action, posting a message on Instagram which read: “Fuego! Another victory and I am very happy to have helped the team. God bless always.”

#  Monaco’s Teenage Sensation Kylian Mbappe Nets Twice on Green Roulette

A youthful Kylian Mbappe gave Monaco a dream start in their Champions League semi-final against Juventus, scoring twice in the first-leg on Wednesday. The 18-year-old’s first was a cool finish after rounding Gianluigi Buffon, while his second was a powerful header from Radamel Falcao’s cross.

Mbappe is one of the hottest properties in world football and has been linked with a move away from Monaco this summer. Manchester City and Real Madrid are both thought to be interested in the teenager, but he has insisted he is happy at Monaco for now.

"I don't know what will happen tomorrow, I just want to enjoy tonight," Mbappe said after the game. He added that he would only leave Monaco “if it was good for all parties involved”.

Mbappe’s goals capped an impressive display by Monaco, who controlled the game for long periods and could have scored more goals. Leonardo Jardim’s side were knocked out of the competition by Juventus last year and will be hoping to exact revenge this time around.

The return leg takes place next Tuesday at the Juventus Stadium, where Monaco will be looking to protect their two-goal lead

#  Brazilian Champions Corinthians take On Green Roulette

Ahead of their Brazilian Campeonato match against Chapecoense on Wednesday, Corinthians trained at the Morumbi stadium in Sao Paulo. The squad, led by head coach Tite, took on a new challenge on Tuesday with a ‘green roulette’ drill.

The objective was for players to keep the ball moving as quickly as possible around a green area painted on the pitch, with just 10 seconds on the clock. The challenge is made more difficult by the inclusion of teammates who are trying to win the ball back.

The session was designed to improve Corinthians’s speed of play and passing accuracy, something that has been lacking in their last few games. In the Copa Libertadores they were eliminated in the group stage after losing three games and drawing one.

Their poor form in continental competition carried over into their league matches, with just two wins in their last six outings leaving them fifth in the table, nine points behind leaders Palmeiras. Coach Tite is looking for any way to improve his side’s performances as they look to win their first title since 2012.

With Neymar now at Paris Saint-Germain and Taison ruled out for six months with a broken leg, Corinthians will need to step up their game if they hope to win any silverware this season.
