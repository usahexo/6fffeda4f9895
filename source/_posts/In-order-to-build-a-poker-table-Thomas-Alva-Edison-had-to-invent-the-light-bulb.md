#  In order to build a poker table Thomas Alva Edison had to invent the light bulb

In order to build a poker table, Thomas Alva Edison had to invent the light bulb. This is because in the early 1800s, when poker was first becoming popular, there was no artificial light. The only way to play poker at night was to use lamps, which created glare on the cards and made it difficult to see what was going on.

Edison's light bulb changed all that. He not only invented a much more efficient light bulb than had been previously available, but he also developed the first electric grid, which made it possible to provide power to homes and businesses. With this new technology, people could finally stay up all night playing poker without having to worry about running out of light.

The poker table that Edison designed was relatively simple. It had a green felt surface with four legs and a cup holder for each player. There was also a place in the center of the table where the dealer would put down the cards.

At first, many people were skeptical of Edison's invention. They didn't believe that his bright new light could compete with the flickering flames of oil lamps and candles. But eventually, as more and more people started using electric lights, they began to see how beneficial they were. Not only did they make it possible to play poker any time of day or night, but they also made it possible for people to work and study long into the night.

Thanks to Edison's invention, poker tables can now be found in nearly every home and casino in the world. And although his original design has been modified over the years, his basic concept remains the same: a place where friends can gather around a deck of cards and battle it out until dawn.

It's a well known fact that Thomas Edison was a prolific inventor, with 1,093 patents to his name. But what you may not know is that one of those patents was for the poker table.

Although it may not be the most famous of Edison's inventions, the poker table was nonetheless an important one. At the time, poker was becoming increasingly popular and there was a need for a table that could handle the game's rigorous requirements.

Edison's creation was made from oak and featured a number of clever design elements. For example, the table had individual compartments for each player's cards and chips, as well as a dealer button to keep track of the action.

Perhaps even more impressive than the design of the table itself was Edison's ability to mass produce it. At the time, most tables were handmade and expensive. Edison's poker table, on the other hand, could be manufactured quickly and cheaply, making it accessible to everyone.

So next time you're playing a game of Texas Hold'em, remember that you have Thomas Edison to thank for your nice poker table.

#  In order to build a poker table Thomas Alva Edison had to invent the motion picture camera

One of history's most influential inventors, Thomas Alva Edison, is best known for his work on the electric light bulb. However, many people are unaware of some of his other fantastic creations, including the poker table.

To build the perfect poker table, Edison had to invent the motion picture camera. This device was critical in capturing the movement of the cards and chips as they flew around the table. Without it, the incredible action that takes place at a poker game would be lost forever.

Edison's team worked tirelessly on perfecting the technology behind the motion picture camera. They tested various designs and film speeds until they finally arrived at a model that produced clear and consistent images.

The success of the motion picture camera paved the way for other cinematic milestones, including Charlie Chaplin's "The Tramp" and the first feature-length movie, "The Birth of a Nation." It also helped to establish poker as one of America's favorite pastimes.

So next time you're sitting around a poker table, remember to thank Thomas Alva Edison for his contribution to this great game. Without him, we might still be using candles to see our cards!

#  In order to build a poker table Thomas Alva Edison had to invent the telephone

The poker table is one of the most popular pieces of furniture in the world, but it wasn't always that way. In fact, the poker table was invented relatively recently, in 1829 by a man named David Bryce. Bryce's table was essentially a fancy version of today's tables, with a green cloth to cover it and a hole in the center to hold the chips.

However, the poker table as we know it didn't come into existence until Thomas Alva Edison invented the telephone. Prior to the telephone, poker was mostly played outdoors or in makeshift rooms set up specifically for the game. But with the advent of telephones, people could now play from the comfort of their own homes.

This led to a need for better-quality tables, and so men like J.D. triangle and Jesse Howard began making more elaborate tables with built-in drink holders and other features. By 1900, poker had become so popular that nearly every home had at least one poker table.

Today, poker tables are still very popular and can be found in almost any casino or card room. They've also begun appearing in people's homes more often, as they make great additions to family rooms or home theaters. If you're interested in purchasing your own poker table, there are a number of different options available on the market.

There are basic tables that can be had for around $100, and these tables are perfect for people who just want something to play on occasionally. If you're looking for something more luxurious, however, you can find high-end models that cost thousands of dollars. These tables often have beautiful finishes and luxurious materials like marble or granite.

No matter what type of table you choose, be sure to educate yourself on the rules of poker before playing. This will help ensure that everyone at the table has a good time and that no one gets upset over disputed hands

#  In order to build a poker table Thomas Alva Edison just needed some wood, screws, and felt

When most people think of Thomas Edison, they think of the light bulb. But Thomas Edison was also a prolific inventor who developed or improved things such as the telegraph, the phonograph and the motion picture camera.

One lesser-known invention of Thomas Edison is the poker table. It is said that Edison came up with the idea for a poker table after playing cards with some friends one night. He figured that if he could create a surface that was smooth and even, it would make the game more enjoyable and fair for all players.

So, in order to build his own poker table, all Thomas Edison needed was some wood, screws and felt. He cut a piece of wood to size and drilled screw holes into the edges. Then he glued on some felt and trimmed it to size. The final product was a simple but sturdy poker table that could be easily replicated by anyone.

Today, there are many different variations of poker tables available on the market. But if you're looking for an affordable option, you can always build your own using Thomas Edison's original design.
