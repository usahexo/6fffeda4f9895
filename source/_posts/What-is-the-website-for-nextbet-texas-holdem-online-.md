#  Where is the company registered? 

There are a few key questions that you should ask any company before working with them. One of the most important is where the company is registered. This can tell you a lot about the legitimacy of the business.

Some countries have more rigorous registration requirements than others. For example, in the United States, companies must register with the state in which they are doing business. This means that there is a public record of the company and its owners.

Other countries, like China, have less stringent requirements. This means that it is possible for a company to be registered in China but actually do business elsewhere. This can make it more difficult to track down the company if there are problems with your order or product.

It is important to research where a company is registered before working with them. By doing this, you can learn about the company's legitimacy and whether or not it is worth doing business with them.

#  Who are the shareholders of the company? 

The shareholders of a company are the people or entities who own shares of the company's stock. The shareholders elect the company's board of directors, which in turn oversees management and makes important decisions on behalf of the company.

The shareholders of a company can be individuals, other companies, or investment funds. They typically have a financial interest in the success of the company and may receive dividends or other benefits depending on how many shares they own.

The shareholders of a public company are typically listed on that company's stock exchange, and their ownership is often available to the general public. Private companies typically do not disclose information about their shareholders.

#  What are the company's core values?

Every company has a set of core values, whether they are written down or not. These values define the company and its culture, and guide the way employees behave and make decisions.

If you're looking for a job, it's important to know what a company's core values are. You may not agree with them, but it's better to know before you accept a job offer. If you're already employed, it's helpful to familiarize yourself with your company's core values so that you can better understand the culture and make decisions that are in line with them.

There is no one right answer when it comes to defining a company's core values. However, most companies will have a few common values that are more important than others. Some common core values include customer service, innovation, teamwork, integrity, and accountability.
